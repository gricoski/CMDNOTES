POWERSHELL::

//Code that allowed me to move all .txt files in desktop to an oldnotes folder on desktop
PS C:\Users\mgricoski\desktop> mv *.txt ~/desktop/oldnotes


LINUX:: (Linux subsystem for Windows, because you can't leave Bill hanging)
//Print a list of items in a directory
dir > whateveryoucallit.txt
// use /s to get to subdirectories... use /b to remove junk
dir /s /b > newname.txt
//filter for specific file types
dir *.jpg > jpgfilesonly.txt
;the list all appears as one line, how to make each file a new line?


TESSERACT COMMAND LINE:
;You can access these all through commandline or though program you write using the API
//Get the words in an image into a text file
tesseract filename.jpg nameofoutputfile
//OCR the words on to a pdf
tesseract file.jpg ouputbase pdf
//run multiple files through tesseract... You need a text file of all files you want to run.
//if txt file is in folder wehre it will run, then you just need the name (e.g. name.jpg).  If it's not
//then you might also need the path.  Either way each file has to be a new line.
tesseract listofjpg.txt outputbase pdf
//You can do this without PDF, but it will probably be too crazy.  

GIT::
//First change to the directory where you have your file to upload or whatever
cd new folder/trash notes/
//if you need to change to a new drive  you can use /d
cd /d m:/new folder/trash/
//If you want the status of what has changed from your directory to git?
git status
//if you see changes and want to bring them into your pc
git pull
//if you make awesome changes and want to send them to git
git add .
//then add a little commit to the change you want to make, make a note about it too
git commit
//then it will open a text editor and depending on program you have to write something and save it.
//After you save you will then want to push your changes to git
git push


GIT COMMIT:
//To save and exit their weird commit thing that isn't nano press esc and then
:wq
